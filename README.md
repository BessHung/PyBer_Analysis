# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analysis report from Pyber ride sharing data and illustrate the differences between the type of city. Creating visualizations of rideshare data and the summary data frame to help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results
The summary table and the multiple-line chart show the facts including: 
- Rural city has the least total rides, total drivers and revenue, but it has the highest average fare per ride and average per driver.
-	Urban city has the highest ride demand and drivers as well as revenue, but it has the lowest average fare per ride and average per driver.
-	Urban city has 2.6 times more rides than suburban city, 13 times more rides than rural city; and it has 2 times more fares than the suburban city, 9.2 times more fares than the rural city.
-	On average, 1 driver has 0.7 rides in urban city, 1.3 rides in suburban city and 1.6 rides in rural city.

## Summary
1.	According to the ratio of total rides and total driver, it would be better to increase the number of drivers in rural cities to meet the demand.
2.	For urban type of city, the total drivers are around 1.5 times more than total rides, which means there are 30% of drivers in urban city are leisure. Pyber can distribute their workers to different type of city, or re-arrange the working time for their workers based on further analysis of weekly, daily demand if required.
3.	Average fare has a huge different between the cities. Pyber can increase the basic fee of each ride, or adjust the fee per mile based on the total distance or rebuild the scale of price depend on the current number of drivers.
